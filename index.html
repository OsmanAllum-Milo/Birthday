      <p class="messageBody">Happy Birthday!!! 

      </p><br><p class="messageBody">I was racking my brain for weeks thinking about something I could get you that was both heartfelt and something I thought you would appreciate. So, these past few weeks I’ve challenged myself to self-teach code and this nooby bit of coding is what I’ve managed to come up with. 

        I hope it (and the following words) manages to bring out that beautiful smile of yours. 

      </p><br><p class="messageBody"> So, Caresse, where to begin… It’s not everyday someone can find a person they just click with the way you and I do. A friend once told me that you can never truly know how much you matter to someone. Be that as it may, I want to take this chance to let you know that you mean so, so much to me Caresse. Although I’ve only known you for a few months, I feel you understand me in a way that few people do, and I remember every single one of your heartfelt actions and messages. You never fail to brighten my day and chatting with you has become something that I always look forward to. Thank you for not only putting up with my goofy antics and terrible humour but matching it with your own. Not many people can do that. Life can be tough but I’m glad I have found someone to shoulder it with me. Not only just to be there supporting one another but also someone to grow and evolve with. You bring out the best in me and every night I tell the moon how glad I am that fate wove you into my life Caresse.  

      </p><br><p class="messageBody"> I would give anything to celebrate your big day with you in person but nevertheless, 

        I hope you have a fabulous time with the people lucky enough to be with you today. Here’s to celebrating many more birthdays with you.

      </p><br><p class="messageBody"> Love,
